# "Test Your Code Knowledge" Online Quiz

![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

A timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals.

## Description

- Test your knowledge of JavaScript and compete against yourself or your friends to get the highest score!
- The test questions are custom-designed to review tricky details. Some are easier than others - don't get fooled!
- As a student of JavaScript, I want to be able to use this quiz as a virtual study session and gamified flashcard-style review.
- By implementing a timer, you must get to the correct answer quickly. A wrong answer will penalize your time. The score is your best time.
- This is not as easy as it seems...what will be your highest score?
